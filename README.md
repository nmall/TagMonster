## TagMonster##

TagMonster is a cutesy retro-style proof of concept for the "gamification" of adding metadata to image files.  It is inspired by old educational games like Number-munchers and ReCAPTCHA.

### Tech ###
TagMonster is written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) atop the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) game platform.

The game was created during a freeform hackathon / code-jam event called #48Create at [Widen Enterprises Inc.](http://www.widen.com).  Participants are given 48 hours to create projects that suite or compliment Marketing Technology.
